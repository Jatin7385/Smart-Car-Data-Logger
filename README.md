This is a Smart Car Data Logger, built using Arduino and a few sensors
# Introduction
In many cases of car accidents, the condition of the vehicle is
bad, and the reason for the accident is impossible to know. Some accidents are
caused due to negligence by the driver. Design a system that will let the user monitor
the condition of their vehicle. If possible, automate various safety measures in the
vehicle. Use appropriate sensors and components to accomplish the same. Various
reasons for motor accidents and vehicular deaths could be, but not restricted to,
heatstroke, CO poisoning, car imbalance/instability etc.
